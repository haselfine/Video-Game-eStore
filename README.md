# Video-Game-eStore
This program uses a SQL database to allow users to access and “purchase” games. It converts table data into objects, including picture BLOBs using a memory stream (could use API instead). After the user selects games to add to their cart, they can view their total and “checkout” which updates sales data in the database.
